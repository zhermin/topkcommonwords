Use scripts to compile and submit your codes
$ sbatch slurm_run.sh           # compile and run your code on sample dataset
$ squeue -u <username>          # check status of your task, if the queue is empty means that the task is finished
$ cat ASSIGN_1.out              # check result
$ ./submit			# submit your codes (You can submit multiple times before due time)
These scripts will also be used on marking. So ensure your output format is the same as 'answer.txt'

In this assignment, you should ONLY modify:
-- TopkCommonWords.java

Do NOT add new files. Do NOT define Java packages. The script will compile 'TopkCommonWords.java' as simple java file.
